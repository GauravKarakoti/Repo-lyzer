- **A GitHub account**  
- *(Optional)* GitHub Personal Access Token to avoid rate limits  

---

## 📐 Guidelines

- Keep GitHub API logic inside `internal/github`
- Keep scoring logic isolated in `internal/analyzer`
- Keep UI rendering inside `internal/output`
- Avoid mixing API, logic, and UI code

---

## 🔐 GitHub API & Tokens
Repo-lyzer uses the GitHub REST API and may hit rate limits.

Optional: Use a Personal Access Token.

Create a token and export it:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Repo-lyzer will automatically detect and use it.

⚠️ Never commit tokens or secrets.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Guidelines

### Go Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Keep functions small and readable
- Prefer clear logic over clever tricks

### TUI & UX

- Keep layouts responsive to terminal size
- Avoid hardcoded widths when possible
- Ensure output remains readable on small terminals
- Test changes with repositories of different sizes and activity levels

### ⚡ Performance

- Minimize unnecessary API calls
- Handle large repositories gracefully
- Cache or batch requests when possible

---

## ➕ Adding Features

Before implementing large features:

- Open an issue describing the idea
- Explain why it's useful
- Discuss the approach if it affects architecture or scoring

This avoids duplicated work and design conflicts.

---

## 🧪 Testing

While automated tests are limited due to API usage and TUI complexity, manually test with:

- Highly active repositories
- Old but inactive repositories
- Both Analyze and Compare modes
- With and without a GitHub token

---

## 🔀 Submitting a Pull Request

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Ensure:

- Code builds successfully
- TUI renders correctly
- No secrets are committed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Add: short description of change"
```

### 4. Push and Open a PR

```bash
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 📝 Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a PR, include:

- What the change does
- Why it's needed
- Screenshots (for UI changes)

### Commit Message Examples

- `Add: recruiter summary panel`
